  Rev 1.41    22/02/2024 AWhyman
  a. Property SSLProtocolVersion added to TSocket. This returns the SSL/TLS protocol
  version that was negotiated when the session was created.

  b. SSL Headers now loaded using the OpenSSLLoader unit in order to support
  OpenSSL 3 and later.

  c. New property TOpenSSLSSLOptions.UseSystemRootCACertificateStore. Defaults to true.
  If true then SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths is called. This causes the
  certs in OPENSSLDIR/certs to be used for certificate verification

  d. Windows only: if OPENSSL_DONT_USE_WINDOWS_CERT_STORE not defined  and
  TOpenSSLSSLOptions.UseSystemRootCACertificateStore is true then
  Windows Root Certificate store is also loaded into SSL Context X.509 certificate store.

  e. Direct access to OpenSSL internal data structures (exposed in earlier versions,
  but now opaque (typically 1.1.1 onwards) now uses getter and setter functions
  provided by later versions of OpenSSL libraries with forwards compatibility
  functions (in appropriate SSL Header unit) used to provide getters and setters
  for earlier versions.

  f. New functions: OPenSSLVersion and OpenSSLDir. These are information access
  that return, respectively, the OpenSSL Version string and the OpenSSL Directory.

  Important information concerning OnVerifyPeer:
  Rev 1.39 of February 2005 deliberately broke the OnVerifyPeer interface,
  which (obviously?) only affects programs that implemented that callback
  as part of the SSL negotiation.  Note that you really should always
  implement OnVerifyPeer, otherwise the certificate of the peer you are
  connecting to is NOT checked to ensure it is valid.

  Prior to this, if the SSL library detected a problem with a certificate
  or the Depth was insufficient (i.e. the "Ok" parameter in VerifyCallback
  is 0 / FALSE), then irrespective of whether your OnVerifyPeer returned True
  or False, the SSL connection would be deliberately failed.

  This created a problem in that even if there was only a very minor
  problem with one of the certificates in the chain (OnVerifyPeer is called
  once for each certificate in the certificate chain), which the user may
  have been happy to accept, the SSL negotiation would be failed.  However,
  changing the code to allow the SSL connection when a user returned True
  for OnVerifyPeer would have meant that existing code which depended on
  automatic rejection of invalid certificates would then be accepting
  invalid certificates, which would have been an unacceptable security
  change.

  Consequently, OnVerifyPeer was changed to deliberately break existing code
  by adding an AOk parameter.  To preserve the previous functionality, your
  OnVerifyPeer event should do "Result := AOk;".  If you wish to consider
  accepting certificates that the SSL library has considered invalid, then
  in your OnVerifyPeer, make sure you satisfy yourself that the certificate
  really is valid and then set Result to True.  In reality, in addition to
  checking AOk, you should always implement code that ensures you are only
  accepting certificates which are valid (at least from your point of view).

}
{
  RLebeau 1/12/2011: Breaking OnVerifyPeer event again, this time to add an
  additional AError parameter (patch courtesy of "jvlad", dmda@yandex.ru).
  This helps user code distinquish between Self-signed and invalid certificates.
